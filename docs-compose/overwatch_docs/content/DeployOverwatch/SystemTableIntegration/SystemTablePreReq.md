This section will walk you through the steps necessary as a prerequisite for System Table Integration with Overwatch.

* **Workspace** should be **UC enabled** and **System Table enabled**. Enabling system tables is straightforward, 
you do need to have at least one unity-catalog enabled workspace. System tables must be enabled by an account admin. 
You can enable system tables using the Unity Catalog REST API.  Once enabled, the tables will appear in a catalog 
called system, which is included in every Unity Catalog metastore. In the system catalog youâ€™ll see schemas such as 
access and billing that contain the system tables. Follow the documents to enable 
[System Tables](https://docs.databricks.com/en/administration-guide/system-tables/index.html#enable-system-tables)
* Overwatch Pipeline **Cluster** must be **UC enabled** (single user and Databricks runtime version >= 11.3).
* For multi account deployment Overwatch Pipeline **Cluster** must be **UC enabled** (single user and Databricks runtime version >= 13.3).
* Overwatch latest version(0.8.0.0) should be deployed in the workspace
