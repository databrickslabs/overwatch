## Providing Access to Consumers
Now that Overwatch is deployed, it's likely that you want to share some or all of the data with its stakeholders.
We've made that easy to do across workspaces with a single function and it's parameters. This is a one time command 
that must be run on the workspace that wants to consumer the Overwatch Data.

### Registering Overwatch On Remote Workspaces

### Requirements
-- note for Sourav the storage prefix must be accessible for clusters that are to access the data either with 
direct cluster access via SPN configs or Instance Profile.
    -- may also be mounted to provide access to everyone on the workspace
