## Overwatch Deployment Configuration

### How it works
Overwatch deployment is driven by a configuration file which will ultimately be loaded into the deployment as 
a csv format. This csv file will contain all the necessary details to perform the deployment. Since CSVs are a bit 
cantankerous we've offered two different methods for building the configuration file. If you're good at VSCode or 
similar text editor and want to edit the CSV directly feel free to do so.

**IF YOU INTEND TO USE EXCEL (RECOMMENDED)** note that Excel may alter several pieces of the CSV; thus we recommend you **complete 
all your edits in the .xlsx file** and then Save As a .csv extension. Before you upload the file spot-check the CSV 
to ensure everything looks correct. Rest assured though, there are many 
[validations]({{%relref "DeployOverwatch/ConfigureOverwatch/Validation.md"%}}) that will alert you if there are 
any issues.

**IF YOU INTEND TO USE CSV** do not open or edit the CSV in Excel unless you're skilled with editing CSVs in Excel. 
Excel may attempt to auto-format certain fields and can break the required format, especially workspace_id and date 
fields.

Regardless of the method you choose, **DO NOT DELETE FIELDS** you don't think you need. If the field doesn't pertain 
to you just leave it blank to avoid any strange issues when parsing the CSV.

### Building Your Config

Please use the template **072x_overwatch_deployment_config_template** 
([.XLSX](/assets/DeployOverwatch/072x_overwatch_deployment_config_template.xlsx) | 
[.CSV](/assets/DeployOverwatch/072x_overwatch_deployment_config_template.csv))

**To Download** Right-click the file type you want and click "Save link as..." or "Save target as..."

For release < 072X please See [Deployment Configuration]({{%relref "DeployOverwatch/ConfigureOverwatch/ConfigFileList.md"%}}/) for details.
