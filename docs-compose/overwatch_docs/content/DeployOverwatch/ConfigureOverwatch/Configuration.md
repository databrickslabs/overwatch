## Overwatch Deployment Configuration

### How it works
Overwatch deployment is driven by a configuration file which will ultimately be loaded into the deployment as 
a csv format or delta table. This configuration will contain all the necessary details to perform the deployment. Since CSVs are a bit 
cantankerous we've offered two different methods for building the configuration file. If you're good at VSCode or 
similar text editor and want to edit the CSV directly feel free to do so. We **strongly** recommend that you create a delta 
table with the csv file you just created and use that as your configuration input. 

**IF YOU INTEND TO USE EXCEL (RECOMMENDED)** note that Excel may alter several pieces of the CSV; thus we recommend you **complete 
all your edits in the .xlsx file** and then Save As a .csv extension. Before you upload the file spot-check the CSV 
to ensure everything looks correct. Rest assured though, there are many 
[validations]({{%relref "DeployOverwatch/ConfigureOverwatch/Validation.md"%}}) that will alert you if there are 
any issues.

**IF YOU INTEND TO USE CSV** do not open or edit the CSV in Excel unless you're skilled with editing CSVs in Excel. 
Excel may attempt to auto-format certain fields and can break the required format, especially workspace_id and date 
fields.

Regardless of the method you choose, **DO NOT DELETE FIELDS** you don't think you need. If the field doesn't pertain 
to you just leave it blank to avoid any strange issues when parsing the CSV.

### Building Your Config

Please use the template for your version. If you are upgrading from 071x to 072x the upgrade script in the change log
will upgrade the script for you.
* 0.8.0.x+ ([.XLSX](/assets/DeployOverwatch/080x_overwatch_deployment_config_template.xlsx) |
  [.CSV](/assets/DeployOverwatch/080x_overwatch_deployment_config_template.csv))
  * Added sql_endpoint column for multi account deployment
* 0.7.2.x+ ([.XLSX](/assets/DeployOverwatch/072x_overwatch_deployment_config_template.xlsx) |
  [.CSV](/assets/DeployOverwatch/072x_overwatch_deployment_config_template.csv))
  * Two column names were changed in 072x to make the scope a little broader
    * "etl_storage_prefix" --> "storage_prefix"
    * "auditlogprefix_source_aws" --> "auditlogprefix_source_path"
* 0.7.1.x ([.XLSX](/assets/DeployOverwatch/071x_overwatch_deployment_config_template.xlsx) |
  [.CSV](/assets/DeployOverwatch/071x_overwatch_deployment_config_template.csv))

#### Azure Event Hub Specific Configurations
When configuring the Azure EH configurations users can use EITHER a **shared access key** OR **AAD SP as of 072x** 
to authenticate to the EH. Below are the required configurations for each auth method. One of the options for Azure 
deployments must be used as EH is required for Azure.

**Shared Access Key Requirements**
Review [Authorizing Access Via SAS Policy]({{%relref "DeployOverwatch/CloudInfra/Azure.md"%}}/#step-21-authorizing-access-via-sas-policy) 
for more details.
