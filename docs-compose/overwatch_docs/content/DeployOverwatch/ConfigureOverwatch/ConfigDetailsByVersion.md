#### Azure Event Hub Specific Configurations
When configuring the Azure EH configurations users can use EITHER a **shared access key** OR **AAD SP as of 072x**
to authenticate to the EH. Below are the required configurations for each auth method. One of the options for Azure
deployments must be used as EH is required for Azure.

**Shared Access Key Requirements**
