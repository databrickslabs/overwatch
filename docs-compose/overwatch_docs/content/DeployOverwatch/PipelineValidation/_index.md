## Overview

The Overwatch Validation Framework is a comprehensive solution designed to enhance the efficiency and robustness of
Overwatch within Databricks deployments. Overwatch serves as a critical tool for customers, employees, and partners,
facilitating the easy understanding and management of operations. As the enterprise adoption of Databricks grows,
the demand for strong governance, cost tracking, optimization opportunities, and the ability to conduct "What If"
experiments increases. The Validation Framework is developed to address and mitigate data quality, inconsistency,
and cost-related issues that have been observed in the recent past. These issues can lead to delays in deployments,
upgrades, integration testing, and the resolution of customer issues.

## What is the Validation Framework

The Validation Framework is an integral part of Overwatch, designed to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of data throughout the deployment process. It employs a series of checks and balances that are automatically applied to data as it is processed and analyzed within Overwatch. The framework is built on several key components:

1. **Data Quality Checks:** These checks validate the accuracy and consistency of data, ensuring that it meets predefined quality standards. This includes verification of data formats, ranges, and the integrity of relationships among data entities.

2. **Completeness Checks:** To ensure no critical data is missing, completeness checks are performed. These checks are crucial for accurate reporting and analysis, enabling users to make informed decisions based on complete datasets.

3. **Reliability Assurance:** The framework assesses the reliability of data sources and processing pipelines, ensuring that data is consistently available and accurately processed over time.

4. **Cost Monitoring:** By integrating cost monitoring into the validation process, the framework helps identify and address potential cost-related issues before they escalate, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

5. **Governance and Compliance:** The framework supports governance at various dimensions, ensuring that data management practices comply with internal and external regulations and standards.

6. **Optimization Detection:** It automatically identifies optimization opportunities within Databricks deployments, suggesting improvements that can enhance performance and reduce costs.

7. **Scenario Simulation:** The framework supports "What If" experiments, allowing users to simulate different scenarios and assess their potential impact on operations and costs.

## Advantages of the Validation Framework

Implementing the Overwatch Validation Framework offers numerous benefits:

1. **Enhanced Data Integrity:** By ensuring data accuracy, completeness, and reliability, the framework significantly reduces the risk of data-related issues that can impact operations and decision-making.

2. **Operational Efficiency:** The automated checks and balances streamline the deployment process, reducing delays and improving the speed of upgrades and integration testing.

3. **Cost Savings:** Early detection and resolution of cost-related issues prevent unnecessary expenditure, optimizing resource utilization across deployments.

4. **Improved Governance:** The framework supports robust governance practices, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and internal policies.

5. **Proactive Optimization:** By identifying optimization opportunities, the framework enables proactive improvements to system performance and cost efficiency.

6. **Informed Decision-Making:** The ability to conduct "What If" experiments empowers users to make informed decisions by understanding the potential impact of operational changes.

7. **Customer Satisfaction:** Reducing delays and resolving issues more efficiently leads to improved customer satisfaction and trust in Databricks deployments.
