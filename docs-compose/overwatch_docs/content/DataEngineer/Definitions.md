## Consumption Layer "Tables" (Views)
All end users should be hitting consumer tables first. Digging into lower layers gets significantly more complex.
Below is the data model for the consumption layer. The consumption layer is often in a stand-alone database apart
from the ETL tables to minimize clutter and confusion. These entities in this layer are actually not tables at all
(with a few minor exceptions such as lookup tables) but rather views. This allows for the Overwatch development team
to alter the underlying columns, names, types, and structures without breaking existing transformations. Instead, 
view column names will remain the same but may be repointed to a newer version of a column, etc. 

{{% notice note %}}
ETL should not be developed atop the consumption layer views but rather the gold layer. Before Overwatch version 
upgrades, it's important that the engineering team review the change list and upgrade requirements before upgrading.
These upgrades may require a remap depending on the changes. As of version 1.0 release, all columns in the gold layer
will be underscored with their schema version number, column changes will reference the later release version but the 
views published with Overwatch will almost always point to the latest version of each column and will not include the
schema suffix to simplify the data model for the average consumer.

### Data Organization
The large gray boxes in the simplified ERD below depict the two major, logical sections of the data model:
* **Databricks Platform** - Metadata captured by the Databricks platform that can be used to assist in workspace
  governance. This data can also be enriched with the Spark data enabling in-depth analyses. The breadth of metadata
  is continuing to grow, stay tuned for additional capabilities.
* **Spark UI** The spark UI section is derived from the spark event logs and essentially contains every single piece
  of data from the Spark UI. There are a few sections that are not included in the first release but the data is 
  present in *spark_events_bronze* albeit extremely complex to derive. The Overwatch development team is working 
  tirelessly to expose additional SparkUI data and will publish as soon as it's ready.

Most tables below provide a data **SAMPLE** for reference. You may either click to view it or 
right click the SAMPLE link and click saveTargetAs or saveLinkAs and save the file.
Note that these files are **TAB** delimited, so you will need to view as such if you save to local file. 
The data in the files were generated from an Azure, test deployment created by Overwatch Developers.

#### Cluster
[**SAMPLE**](/assets/TableSamples/cluster.tab)

**KEY** -- organization_id + cluster_id + action + unixTimeMS_state_start

{{% notice warning %}}
[Issue 154](https://github.com/databrickslabs/overwatch/issues/154): This table is not a properly defined slow-changing
dimensions as it should be. This table more closely resembles the audit log which is very dependent on the action
column and does not reference the complete state of the object at the corresponding time. Furthermore, this table
only receives updates when the definition of the object is modified, thus, in the early days of Overwatch, there will
likely be a lot of missing data. <br><br>
Use this table as a left-joined lookup table with the last non-null lookup value where the timestamp is < lookup time.
This will result in many null values that must be further filled from the corresponding snapshot table in the etl
database.

days (i.e. divide by days_in_state) when trying to calculate costs by day. Also, note that costs may not be captured
for a cluster_state combination until that state ends.

### InstanceDetails
[**AWS Sample**](/assets/TableSamples/instancedetails_aws.tab) | [**AZURE_Sample**](/assets/TableSamples/instancedetails_azure.tab)

**KEY** -- Organization_ID + API_name

This table is unique and it's purpose is to enable users to identify node specific contract costs associated with 
Databricks and the Cloud Provider through time. 
Defaults are loaded as an example by workspace. These defaults should closely (if not perfectly) 
represent your cloud node details including costs, CPUs, etc. Everytime Overwatch runs, it validates the presence of 
this table and whether it has any data present for the current worksapce, if it does not creates / appends the relevant
data to it; otherwise no action is taken. This gives the user the ability to extend / customize this table to fit their 
needs by workspace. Each organization_id (workspace), should provide complete cost data for each node used in that
region. If you decide to completely customize the table, it's critical to note that **some columns are required** for the ETL
to function; these fields include are indicated below in the table with an asterisk.

The organization_id (i.e. workspace id) is automatically generated for each workspace if that organization_id is not
present in the table already (or the table is not present at all). Each workspace
(i.e. organization_id) often has unique costs, this table enables you to customize compute pricing.

This table currently tracks costs for machine AND DBUs which is confusing. [Issue 153](https://github.com/databrickslabs/overwatch/issues/153)
has been created to resolve this confusion. Until this issue is complete, any DBU contract price changes via the 
Overwatch config will expire all existing compute pricing and add a new record with the updated DBU costs. This will 
happen automagically as long as the user only changes the DBU contract prices via the Overwatch config. To simplify, 
only manually edit this table when adjusting costs for compute and/or when historically adjusting compute/dbu costs.

**IMPORTANT** This table must be configured such that there are no overlapping costs and no gaps in costs within 
a single organization_id between primordial date and current date. 
This means that when one record for a node type is "expired", a new one must be created 
with the expiry date (activeUntil of the expired record) must == activeFrom of the new record and the active record must
a null for the activeUntil date.

#### JobRunCostPotentialFact
[**SAMPLE**](/assets/TableSamples/jobruncostpotentialfact.tab)

**KEY** -- organization_id + job_id + id_in_job

This fact table defines the job, the cluster, the cost, the potential, and utilization (if cluster logging is enabled) 
of a cluster associated with a specific Databricks Job Run.

**Dimensionality** Note that this fact table is not normalized by time but rather by job run and cluster state. 
Costs are not derived from job runs but from clusters thus the state\[s\] of the cluster are what's pertinent when
tying to cost. This is **extremely important** in the case of long running jobs, such as streaming. 

SCENARIO: <br>
Imagine a streaming job with 12 concurrent runs on an existing cluster that run for 20 days at the end of which the 
driver dies for some reason causing all runs fail and begin retrying but failing. When the 20 days end, the cost will 
be captured solely on that date and even more importantly, not only will all 20 days be captured at that date but the 
cost associated will be cluster runtime for 20 days * number of runs. Overwatch will automatically smooth the costs
across the concurrent runs but not the days running since this fact table is not based by on an equidistant time axis. 

* Potential: Total core_milliseconds for which the cluster COULD execute spark tasks. This derivation only includes
  the worker nodes in a state ready to receive spark tasks (i.e. Running). Nodes being added or running init scripts
  are not ready for spark jobs thus those core milliseconds are omitted from the total potential.
* Cost: Derived from the [instanceDetails](#instancedetails) table and DBU configured contract price (see
  [**Configuration**](({{%relref "GettingStarted/Configuration.md"%}})) for more details).
  The compute costs in [instanceDetails](#instancedetails) table are taken from the "Compute_Contract_Price" values associated with the
  instance type in instanceDetails.
* Utilization: Utilization is a function of core milliseconds used during spark task execution divided by the total
  amount of core milliseconds available given the cluster size and state. (i.e. spark_task_runtime_H / worker_potential_core_H)
* Cluster State: The state\[s\] of a cluster during a run. As the cluster scales and morphs to accommodate the run's 
  needs, the state changes. The number of state changes are recorded in this table as "run_cluster_states".
* Run State: Advanced Topic for data engineers and developers. This topic is discussed in considerable detail in the 
  [Advanced Topics]({{%relref "GettingStarted/AdvancedTopics.md"%}}) section.
  Given a cluster state, the run state is a state of all runs on a cluster at a given moment in time. This 
  is the measure used to calculate shared costs across concurrent runs. A run state cannot pass the boundaries of 
  a cluster state, a run that continues across cluster-state lines will result in a new run state.

{{% notice warning %}}
[Issue 154](https://github.com/databrickslabs/overwatch/issues/154): This table is not a properly defined slow-changing
dimensions as it should be. This table more closely resembles the audit log which is very dependent on the action
column and does not reference the complete state of the object at the corresponding time. Furthermore, this table
only receives updates when the definition of the object is modified, thus, in the early days of Overwatch, there will
likely be a lot of missing data. <br><br>
Use this table as a left-joined lookup table with the last non-null lookup value where the timestamp is < lookup time.
This will result in many null values that must be further filled from the corresponding snapshot table in the etl
database.

For deeper insights regarding audit, please reference [auditLogSchema](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-settings/audit-logs.html#request-parameters).
This is simplified through the use of the *ETL_DB.audit_log_bronze* and filter where serviceName == accounts for example.
Additionally, you may filter down to specific actions using "actionName". An example query is provided below:

```scala
spark.table("overwatch.audit_log_bronze")

## ETL Tables
The following are the list of potential tables, the module with which it's created and the layer in which it lives.
This list consists of only the ETL tables created to facilitate and deliver the [consumption layer](#consumption-layer-tables)
<br><br>
The gold and consumption layers are the only layers that maintain column name uniformity and naming convention across
all tables. Users should always reference Consumption and Gold layers unless the data necssary has not been curated.
