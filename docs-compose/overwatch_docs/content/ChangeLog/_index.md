## 0.4.13
* Hotfix for [Issue 138](https://github.com/databrickslabs/overwatch/issues/138)

An upgrade to this minor release is only necessary if you're experience api limits and/or seeing 429 issues. 
Otherwise, this release can be skipped as the fix will be in 0.4.2+. New users should use this version until 
the next release is published.

## 0.4.12
**[SCHEMA UPGRADE]({{%relref "DataEngineer/Upgrade.md"%}}) REQUIRED**
* Hotfix for [Issue 126](https://github.com/databrickslabs/overwatch/issues/126).
* Hotfix for [Issue 129](https://github.com/databrickslabs/overwatch/issues/129).
* Schema upgrade capability enabled.
  * To upgrade your schema to 0.412, all you need to do is follow the 
  example in the notebook below.
    * ([HTML](/assets/ChangeLog/Upgrade_Example.html) / [DBC](/assets/ChangeLog/Upgrade_Example.dbc))
* Corrected case sensitivity issue. When failure would occur in spark_events_bronze, there were column references 
  to state tables with mismatched column name case sensitivity causing errors
* Corrected issue with missing quotes around update statement to track failed files in 
  spark_events_processedFiles

## 0.4.11
* Hotfix for [Issue 119](https://github.com/databrickslabs/overwatch/issues/119). Issue was only present in edge cases.
  Edge cases include workspaces missing data and attempting to run modules for which data didn't exist.
* Added additional guard rails to pipeline state checks to help clarify workspace / pipeline state issues for
  future users.

## 0.4.1
* [Converted all delta targets from managed tables to external tables](https://github.com/databrickslabs/overwatch/issues/50)
    * Better security and best practice
    * Enabled etl data path prefix to simplify and protect the raw data across workspaces
* pipeline_report - enabled partitioning by "organization_id"
    * Necessary to guard against write concurrency issues across multiple workspaces
* orgianization_id - Single Tenant AWS workspaces with DNS would return "0" for organization_id, updated to change
  organization_id to the workspace prefix.
    * EXAMPLE: https://myorg_dev.cloud.databricks.com --> myorg_dev
* instanceDetails -
    * Converted from append mode to overwrite mode. Allows for multiple workspaces to create the compute pricing lookup
      if it didn't already exist for the workspace
    * Moved default table location from consumerDB to ETLDB and created mapped view to table in consumerDB
    * Simplified the instanceDetails cost customization process (docs updated)
    * Added proper filter to ensure ONLY current workspace compute costs are looked up during joins
    * Converted Azure example Memory_GB to double to match data type from AWS
* Bug fix for JSON to Map that caused certain escaped json strings to break when being pulled from the new Jobs UI
* Bug fix for [Issue 111](https://github.com/databrickslabs/overwatch/issues/111)
* Bug fix for multi-workspace Azure, filter from audit_raw_land table was incomplete
* Bug fix to allow for consumerDB to be omitted from DataTarget in config
