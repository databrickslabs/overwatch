      <description>Run Methods Overwatch is usually run via one of two methods:
 As a job controlling running a notebook As a job running the main class with the configs  Below are instructions for both methods. The primary difference is the way by which the configuration is implemented and the choice of which to use is entirely user preference. Overwatch is meant to control itself from soup to nuts meaning it creates its own databases and tables and manages all spark parameters and optimization requirements to operate efficiently.</description>

Configuration Basics The Overwatch configuration can be created as a case class of OverwatchParams or as a json string passed into the main class com.databricks.labs.overwatch.BatchRunner. When passed in as a json string, it is deserialized into an instance of OverwatchParams.</description>
