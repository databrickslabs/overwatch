There are two primary sources of data that need to be configured:
Audit Logs-GCP These will be delivered to the configured bucket. These buckets are configured on a per-workspace basis and can be delivered to the same target bucket, just ensure that the prefixes are different to avoid collisions. We don&amp;rsquo;t want multiple workspaces delivering into the same prefix.</description>

      <description>Configuring Overwatch on AWS - Databricks Reach out to your Customer Success Engineer (CSE) to help you with these tasks as needed.
There are two primary sources of data that need to be configured:
Audit Logs-AWS The audit logs contain data for every interaction within the environment and are used to track the state of various objects through time along with which accounts interacted with them. This data is relatively small and delivery occurs infrequently which is why it&amp;rsquo;s rarely of any consequence to deliver audit logs to buckets even outside of the control plane region.</description>
