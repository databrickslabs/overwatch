CONTRIBUTING TO OVERWATCH

At present, external contributions EXCEPT for unit / integration tests are suspended. 
Additional tests are required to ensure the stability of the project. Tests are being developed as quickly as 
possible to open this up to a broader audience. 

Please file a GitHub issue to notify us of any bugs. Public-facing enhancement requests are tracked using GitHub
issues as well.

Full open source contributions are the goal.
