CONTRIBUTING TO OVERWATCH

At present, external contributions are not accepted, 
this is under further review but feel free to fork the project as you see fit.

Internal Databricks employees are welcome to contribute but are currently limited to tests
and supporting refactorings until sufficient tests are in place. If you're interested in 
developing tests please do reach out or look for issues labeled, "TestsNeeded"
